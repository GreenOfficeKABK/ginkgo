      <h2>The Gathering Leaf — News & Upcoming Events</h2>
      <p>

One day, a young ant named Pip looked around and said, “So many ants care about sustainability, but we never talk about it together!” So Pip placed a large leaf in the center of the colony, inviting others to write down ideas and discussion topics. That leaf became the heart of their monthly gatherings.
Today, The Gathering Leaf lives on as the section where we share news, updates, and upcoming events — a space where our community comes together, just like Pip’s inspired meetings in the forest.

    <h2>Welcome to the Ginkgo Colony — A Story of Sustainability and Community</h2>
    <p>
     Deep in the heart of the forest lived a remarkable ant colony called Ginkgo. Unlike others that focused only on gathering food, the Ginkgo ants had a bigger mission: to build a thriving, sustainable community where every ant could learn, share, and help care for their home.
Just as the colony lived in harmony with nature, our website does too — powered entirely by solar energy. It’s a small but meaningful step toward a greener future, showing that technology and sustainability can grow hand in hand.
